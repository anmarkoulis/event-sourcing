# Speaker Notes: Event Sourcing & CQRS with FastAPI and Celery

## Slide 1: Title Slide (30 seconds)
**Key Points:**
- Welcome everyone to PyCon Athens
- Mention this is about a mindset shift in how we think about data
- The title is a play on "Dr. Strangelove" - events can be scary but powerful
- Set expectation: 30 minutes, lots of code examples, interactive

**Speaking Notes:**
"Good morning everyone! I'm excited to be here at PyCon Athens. Today we're going to talk about something that might sound scary at first - raw events. But by the end of this talk, I hope you'll see why I've learned to love them. This is about a fundamental shift in how we think about data in our systems."

---

## Slide 2: Who Am I? (1 minute)
**Key Points:**
- Establish credibility as a staff engineer
- Show real-world experience with scale
- Position as someone who's been through the journey
- Connect with audience's Python experience

**Speaking Notes:**
"I'm a staff engineer who's been working with Python for over a decade. I've built systems that handle millions of events daily, and I've learned the hard way why traditional architectures break down at scale. I'm what you might call an 'event sourcing evangelist' - someone who's recovered from the pain of mutable state and tight coupling. I love immutable data and audit trails, and I want to share why."

---

## Slide 3: The Problem with Traditional Architectures (2 minutes)
**Key Points:**
- Show familiar code that everyone recognizes
- Highlight the problems with this approach
- Connect to real pain points developers face
- Set up the motivation for event sourcing

**Speaking Notes:**
"This is the code we're all familiar with. We get a user, we mutate their state, we save it back. It's simple, it works for small systems. But as your system grows, you start hitting these pain points. Tight coupling means you can't scale reads and writes independently. Poor auditability means you can't answer 'who changed what when?' Mutable state means data corruption risks. And scaling becomes a nightmare because read and write workloads are fundamentally different."

---

## Slide 4: What Are Raw Events? (2 minutes)
**Key Points:**
- Introduce the fundamental concept
- Show concrete examples of events
- Emphasize immutability
- Contrast with traditional approach

**Speaking Notes:**
"Instead of storing current state, we store every change as an immutable event. Look at this - when a user is created, we record a UserCreated event. When their name changes, we record a UserNameChanged event. Each event is immutable, timestamped, and tells us exactly what happened. We're not overwriting history - we're building it."

---

## Slide 5: The Power of Raw Events (1.5 minutes)
**Key Points:**
- Highlight the superpowers this gives you
- Connect to real debugging scenarios
- Show business value
- Build excitement

**Speaking Notes:**
"When you store every change, you get these superpowers. Complete audit trail - every action is recorded. Time travel - you can replay any point in history. Debugging superpowers - you can see exactly what happened when something goes wrong. Data integrity - no more lost changes. And scalability - you can separate read and write concerns."

---

## Slide 6: Core Concept: Event Sourcing (2 minutes)
**Key Points:**
- Explain the fundamental equation
- Show the mental model shift
- Highlight key benefits
- Use the quote to emphasize the concept

**Speaking Notes:**
"This is the fundamental idea of event sourcing: system state equals the result of replaying all events. Instead of saying 'give me the current state,' we say 'replay all events to build the current state.' This gives us immutable history - nothing is ever lost. We can do temporal queries - what was the state at 3pm? We can replay events to rebuild state from scratch. And we have audit by design - every change is recorded."

---

## Slide 7: Core Concept: CQRS (2 minutes)
**Key Points:**
- Explain the separation of concerns
- Show concrete examples
- Bust the Kafka misconception
- Keep it simple

**Speaking Notes:**
"CQRS stands for Command Query Responsibility Segregation. We separate our write model - commands that change state - from our read model - queries that retrieve data. Commands handle business logic and emit events. Queries are optimized for fast, flexible reads. This gives us independent scaling and technology flexibility. And here's the key point: you don't need Kafka to start with CQRS. You can start simple."

---

## Slide 8: Why CQRS Matters (1 minute)
**Key Points:**
- Reinforce the benefits
- Address common misconceptions
- Keep it practical

**Speaking Notes:**
"This separation gives us real benefits. Commands handle business logic and emit events. Queries are optimized for fast, flexible reads. We can scale read and write workloads independently. And we have technology flexibility - maybe we use PostgreSQL for writes and Elasticsearch for reads. And again, you don't need Kafka to start."

---

## Slide 9: Architecture Overview (2 minutes)
**Key Points:**
- Show the high-level flow
- Introduce key components
- Keep it conceptual
- Set up for detailed examples

**Speaking Notes:**
"Here's the high-level flow. External request comes in, we process it as a command, we store the event, we publish it to an event bus, and we update our read model. The key components are FastAPI for our API surface, Celery for async event processing, an event store for our append-only log, a read model optimized for queries, and an event bus for pub/sub communication."

---

## Slide 10: FastAPI: The Command Interface (2 minutes)
**Key Points:**
- Show real FastAPI code
- Emphasize async nature
- Show immediate response pattern
- Keep it practical

**Speaking Notes:**
"Here's how we implement this with FastAPI. We define our commands using Pydantic models. When a request comes in, we validate it, create an event, append it to our event store, publish it to our event bus, and return immediately. Notice we're not waiting for the event to be processed - we return right away. This gives us high availability and responsiveness."

---

## Slide 11: Celery: The Event Processing Engine (2 minutes)
**Key Points:**
- Show Celery task definitions
- Emphasize async processing
- Show business logic separation
- Demonstrate flexibility

**Speaking Notes:**
"Celery is our event processing engine. We define tasks for each event type. When a UserCreated event is published, this task processes it. It can do business logic, update the read model, send emails, notify other services - whatever we need. Each task is independent and can be scaled separately. This gives us tremendous flexibility."

---

## Slide 12: Event Store: The Source of Truth (2 minutes)
**Key Points:**
- Show append-only operations
- Emphasize immutability
- Show stream-based retrieval
- Keep it simple

**Speaking Notes:**
"The event store is our source of truth. It's append-only - we never update or delete events. We store each event with a stream ID, event type, data, and version. To get events for a stream, we query by stream ID and version. This gives us the ability to replay any stream from any point in time."

---

## Slide 13: Replaying Events: Building State (2 minutes)
**Key Points:**
- Show the aggregate pattern
- Demonstrate event application
- Show state reconstruction
- Emphasize simplicity

**Speaking Notes:**
"Here's how we build state by replaying events. We have an aggregate that knows how to apply events. When we want to get the current state of a user, we get all their events and apply them one by one. This is the core of event sourcing - state is just the result of replaying events."

---

## Slide 14: Read Model: Optimized for Queries (1.5 minutes)
**Key Points:**
- Show optimized queries
- Emphasize performance
- Show flexibility
- Keep it practical

**Speaking Notes:**
"Our read model is optimized for queries. We can do fast, direct queries by ID. We can do complex searches. We can optimize for different query patterns. This is where we get the performance benefits of CQRS - our reads are fast because they're optimized for reading, not for consistency with writes."

---

## Slide 15: Eventual Consistency: Feature, Not Bug (2 minutes)
**Key Points:**
- Address the consistency concern
- Show why it's beneficial
- Give concrete examples
- Build confidence

**Speaking Notes:**
"Eventual consistency scares a lot of people, but it's actually a feature. On the command side, we return immediately - high availability. On the query side, we might not have the latest changes yet - but that's okay. This gives us high availability, scalability, and resilience. Failures don't cascade through the system."

---

## Slide 16: Performance: Snapshots (2 minutes)
**Key Points:**
- Address the performance concern
- Show the snapshot pattern
- Demonstrate the improvement
- Keep it practical

**Speaking Notes:**
"One concern with event sourcing is performance - what if you have thousands of events? That's where snapshots come in. We periodically save the state of our aggregates. When we need to build state, we start from the latest snapshot and only replay events after that. This gives us the best of both worlds - performance and auditability."

---

## Slide 17: Debugging in an Immutable World (2 minutes)
**Key Points:**
- Show debugging superpowers
- Give concrete examples
- Emphasize the value
- Connect to real scenarios

**Speaking Notes:**
"This is where event sourcing really shines - debugging. We can see exactly what happened by replaying events. We can compare states at different times. We can answer questions like 'what was the user's state at 3pm?' This is incredibly powerful for debugging production issues."

---

## Slide 18: Fixing Data: Reprocessing History (1.5 minutes)
**Key Points:**
- Show safe data fixes
- Contrast with traditional approach
- Emphasize safety
- Show automation

**Speaking Notes:**
"Instead of scary manual data patches, we emit correction events. This is much safer - we're not directly manipulating data. All our projections will be updated automatically. We maintain our audit trail. And we can replay the fix if needed."

---

## Slide 19: Real-World Gotchas (2 minutes)
**Key Points:**
- Address common challenges
- Show practical solutions
- Keep it real
- Build confidence

**Speaking Notes:**
"Here are some real-world challenges you'll face. Event schema evolution - version your events. Event ordering - use optimistic concurrency. Event size - keep events small and focused. These are solvable problems, and the benefits far outweigh the challenges."

---

## Slide 20: Scaling Patterns (2 minutes)
**Key Points:**
- Show scaling strategies
- Keep it practical
- Show flexibility
- Build confidence

**Speaking Notes:**
"As your system grows, you'll need these scaling patterns. Event store partitioning by stream ID. Read model sharding by user ID. Different Celery worker pools for different event types. This gives you horizontal scalability."

---

## Slide 21: Testing Event-Sourced Systems (1.5 minutes)
**Key Points:**
- Show testing strategies
- Emphasize simplicity
- Show confidence
- Keep it practical

**Speaking Notes:**
"Testing event-sourced systems is actually quite straightforward. Test your aggregates by applying events. Test your event store by appending and retrieving events. The immutability makes testing much more predictable."

---

## Slide 22: Migration Strategy (1.5 minutes)
**Key Points:**
- Show practical migration path
- Emphasize safety
- Show incremental approach
- Build confidence

**Speaking Notes:**
"You don't have to rewrite everything at once. Start with dual write - write to both old and new systems. Then switch reads to the new system. Finally, remove the old system. This gives you a safe migration path."

---

## Slide 23: Key Takeaways (1 minute)
**Key Points:**
- Reinforce main messages
- Keep it memorable
- End strong
- Connect to audience

**Speaking Notes:**
"Here are the key things I want you to remember. Raw events are powerful - they give you audit trails, time travel, and debugging superpowers. The Python ecosystem is ready - FastAPI, Celery, and async/await are perfect for this. Start simple - you don't need complex infrastructure. Event sourcing is a mindset shift - think in terms of what happened, not what is. And your system should explain itself - six months from now, you'll thank yourself."

---

## Slide 24: Questions to Challenge Your Architecture (1 minute)
**Key Points:**
- Give actionable questions
- Encourage thinking
- End with reflection
- Connect to next steps

**Speaking Notes:**
"Before your next project, ask yourself these questions. What if I stored every change instead of just current state? How would I debug this if I could replay every action? What would complete audit trails mean for my business? Could I separate read and write concerns? What if my data was immutable? These questions will help you think differently about your architecture."

---

## Slide 25: Thank You (30 seconds)
**Key Points:**
- Thank the audience
- Provide contact info
- Invite questions
- End warmly

**Speaking Notes:**
"Thank you all for your attention. I hope I've convinced you that raw events are worth loving. I'm happy to take questions, and you can find me on Twitter or email. Let's have a great discussion!"

---

## Slide 26: Resources (30 seconds)
**Key Points:**
- Provide further reading
- Show tools and libraries
- Keep it practical
- End with action items

**Speaking Notes:**
"Here are some resources to dive deeper. These books will give you the theoretical foundation. These tools and libraries will help you implement event sourcing in Python. Start with the simple stuff and work your way up."

---

## Slide 27: Demo Time (30 seconds)
**Key Points:**
- Set up the demo
- Show what we'll build
- Keep it exciting
- End with action

**Speaking Notes:**
"Now let's see this in action! I'm going to build a simple user management system with FastAPI, Celery, and SQLite. We'll see real-time event replay and all the concepts we've discussed. The code will be available on GitHub."

Areas That Could Be Improved
1. The “Celery glue” feels slightly magical

    The Celery dispatch code is clear, but there’s an architectural question missing:

        How do you guarantee event delivery & ordering?

    Do you rely on exactly-once semantics? Are failures retried? Is idempotency enforced in Celery tasks?

👉 Suggestion: Include a small section on event reliability and failure handling. What happens if a Celery worker crashes mid-projection?
2. Not enough on testing

    Immutable systems are testable, but how?

    Would love a quick note or diagram:

        Testing aggregates with command + expected events

        Replaying projections in test environments

👉 Suggestion: Add a slide titled “Testing in an Immutable World” with a short testing pattern or fixture.
3. State transitions and validation

    How do aggregates handle invalid state transitions? (e.g. double-deletion, duplicate emails)

    Where do invariants live—inside aggregates? Inside command handlers?

👉 Suggestion: Make business rules more explicit in your aggregate example.
4. Visual Density

    Some slides (like Command Handler and Celery Integration) are very dense.

    Hard to digest during a live talk.

👉 Suggestion: Break those into two slides—one for structure, one for code.

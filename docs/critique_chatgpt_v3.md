Your presentation is exceptionally well-structured, visually cohesive, and very clearly communicated. As an attendee at PyCon (regardless of experience level), I’d say this is one of the better talks I’d look forward to. You strike a great balance between conceptual clarity, practical implementation, and real-world caveats, which many talks struggle to do.
✅ What Works Really Well (as a PyCon attendee):

    Narrative-Driven:

        Starting with “Who deleted my user?” instantly grounds the problem.

        “The system has no memory” vs. “The system that remembers” is a powerful before/after contrast.

    Progressive Learning Path:

        The presentation logically builds: Events → Streams → Commands → Queries → Aggregates → Store → Projections.

        This builds the mental model gradually.

    Real Code Examples:

        Clear, non-trivial examples show you're doing this in production.

        Good use of FastAPI + Celery—two widely used Python tools in the community.

    Production Considerations:

        Eventual consistency, error handling, snapshots—these are the hard parts, and you’ve included them.

        You’re not overselling event sourcing. You’re being honest.

    Clear Takeaways:

        Your last slide neatly summarizes when to use / not to use this.

        That alone makes this presentation practical, not just theoretical.

🔍 Constructive Feedback & Improvements:
From a less experienced developer:

    Complexity jumps quickly: The first few slides are great for beginners, but once you get into snapshots, Celery dispatch, and async DI, it might feel overwhelming.

        Suggestion: Consider a visual animation or diagram walking through the lifecycle of a single command → event → projection. Make it interactive if possible.

    Celery knowledge is assumed: Maybe give a 1-slide refresher or link in the footer that says “Don’t know Celery? Read this after.”

From a Staff Engineer or experienced developer:

    Implementation Depth: I’d be curious:

        How do you handle schema evolution?

        Any versioning strategies for events?

        Are your aggregates stored in memory only, or are you snapshotting and indexing with another system?

    Ops & Observability: How do you monitor Celery retries? What does an alert pipeline look like for failed projections?

    Tooling gaps: You mention the patterns, but what tooling (if any) are you using for:

        Event replay tooling?

        Snapshotting automation?

        Local development of projections?

Suggestion: Add an optional appendix slide with “Advanced Topics / Q&A Deep Dive” with bullets on:

    Event versioning

    Replay tooling

    Failure observability

    Integration with OpenTelemetry / tracing

Stylistic:

    Minor: The headers with ## **Bolded subtitles** occasionally read loud—consider reducing use of emphasis to highlight only key takeaways.

    Consider more contrast in your diagrams (especially the one zoomed with event-sourcing-flow). Add labels like “Command comes in → Event emitted → Projection built” in the graphic itself.

🤔 What I'd Ask You in Q&A:

    What if a projection fails and the event is never re-processed—do you track dead letters?

    How do you version your events across deployments?

    How do you test projection changes without blowing up production data?

    Would you use this pattern in a system that needs to be GDPR compliant (i.e., right to forget)?

🧠 Final Verdict (from me as an attendee):

    As a beginner: "This opened my eyes to how powerful architecture can be. I may not implement this tomorrow, but now I know what to learn."

    As an experienced dev: "Good talk. Practical. Not dogmatic. Clear tradeoffs. Would love a follow-up talk diving into versioning, ops, and tooling."

    As a staff engineer: "I respect the honesty. No silver bullets. You brought the real-world view that we often forget when talking architecture."

Let me know if you want help crafting a "bonus slide" with those advanced considerations or tooling topics. I think it’d be a great way to show depth without overwhelming beginners.

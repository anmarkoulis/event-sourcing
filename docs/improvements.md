# DDD + CQRS Implementation Improvements

This document outlines the improvements needed to achieve a proper Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) architecture.

## 1. Aggregate Purity (High Priority)

### Current Issues
- Aggregates contain infrastructure concerns (event publishing, external API calls)
- Business logic mixed with technical concerns

### Improvements Needed
- **Purify aggregates** to contain only domain logic
- Move event publishing to application layer
- Extract external API calls to domain services or adapters
- Ensure aggregates are pure domain objects

### Example Refactoring
```python
# Current: Aggregate handles event publishing
class ClientAggregate:
    def handle_salesforce_event(self, event_data):
        # Business logic
        # Event publishing (should be moved out)

# Target: Pure domain logic only
class ClientAggregate:
    def handle_salesforce_event(self, event_data):
        # Only business logic and state changes
        # Return domain events for application layer to handle
```

## 2. External Event Parsing (High Priority)

### Current Issues
- Event parsing logic mixed with domain logic
- Salesforce-specific concerns in aggregates

### Improvements Needed
- **Create adapters** for external event parsing
- Separate Salesforce event format from domain events
- Implement event translators/converters
- Keep aggregates focused on business rules

### Example Structure
```
src/
├── adapters/
│   ├── salesforce/
│   │   ├── event_parser.py
│   │   └── event_translator.py
│   └── external_events/
├── domain/
│   └── aggregates/
└── application/
```

## 3. Domain Services (Medium Priority)

### Current Issues
- Complex business logic scattered across aggregates
- External API calls in aggregates

### Improvements Needed
- **Create domain services** for complex business logic
- Extract Salesforce API interactions to domain services
- Implement business rule engines
- Separate cross-aggregate logic

### Example Domain Services
```python
class ClientDomainService:
    def fetch_client_from_salesforce(self, client_id: str) -> ClientData
    def validate_client_status(self, client_data: ClientData) -> bool
    def determine_event_type(self, existing_client, new_data) -> EventType
```

## 4. Query Handlers (Medium Priority)

### Current Issues
- Direct read model access in application layer
- No clear query handling pattern

### Improvements Needed
- **Implement query handlers** for read model access
- Create query objects/commands
- Separate read and write concerns clearly
- Implement query optimization strategies

### Example Query Structure
```python
class GetClientQuery:
    def __init__(self, client_id: str):
        self.client_id = client_id

class GetClientQueryHandler:
    def handle(self, query: GetClientQuery) -> ClientReadModel:
        # Handle read model access
        pass
```

## 5. Event Store Improvements (Low Priority)

### Current Issues
- Basic event store implementation
- Limited event versioning and concurrency control

### Improvements Needed
- **Implement optimistic concurrency control**
- Add event versioning and conflict resolution
- Implement event replay capabilities
- Add event metadata and correlation IDs

## 6. Command Validation (Medium Priority)

### Current Issues
- Validation logic mixed with command handling
- No clear validation pipeline

### Improvements Needed
- **Implement command validation pipeline**
- Create validation decorators or middleware
- Separate business validation from technical validation
- Implement cross-command validation

### Example Validation Structure
```python
class CommandValidator:
    def validate(self, command: Command) -> ValidationResult:
        # Validate command structure and business rules
        pass

class ValidationMiddleware:
    def process(self, command: Command, handler: CommandHandler):
        # Apply validation before command execution
        pass
```

## 7. Error Handling and Resilience (Medium Priority)

### Current Issues
- Basic error handling
- No retry mechanisms for external calls

### Improvements Needed
- **Implement comprehensive error handling**
- Add retry policies for external API calls
- Implement circuit breakers for external services
- Add dead letter queues for failed events

## 8. Testing Strategy (High Priority)

### Current Issues
- Limited test coverage
- No clear testing patterns for DDD/CQRS

### Improvements Needed
- **Implement comprehensive testing strategy**
- Unit tests for aggregates (pure domain logic)
- Integration tests for command handlers
- Event sourcing tests (event replay, snapshots)
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows

### Testing Structure
```
tests/
├── unit/
│   ├── domain/
│   │   └── aggregates/
│   └── application/
│       └── commands/
├── integration/
│   ├── event_store/
│   └── projections/
└── e2e/
    └── workflows/
```

## 9. Configuration and Environment (Low Priority)

### Current Issues
- Hard-coded configuration
- Limited environment-specific settings

### Improvements Needed
- **Implement configuration management**
- Environment-specific settings
- Feature flags for different behaviors
- Configuration validation

## 10. Monitoring and Observability (Low Priority)

### Current Issues
- Limited monitoring capabilities
- No clear metrics for CQRS operations

### Improvements Needed
- **Add comprehensive monitoring**
- Command/query performance metrics
- Event processing metrics
- Aggregate reconstruction metrics
- External API call monitoring

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Critical - Do First)
1. Aggregate Purity
2. External Event Parsing
3. Testing Strategy

### Phase 2 (Important - Do Soon)
4. Domain Services
5. Query Handlers
6. Command Validation

### Phase 3 (Nice to Have - Do Later)
7. Error Handling and Resilience
8. Event Store Improvements
9. Configuration and Environment
10. Monitoring and Observability

## Success Criteria

After implementing these improvements, the system should have:

- ✅ Pure domain aggregates with no infrastructure concerns
- ✅ Clear separation between external events and domain events
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for all layers
- ✅ Proper CQRS implementation with clear read/write separation
- ✅ Resilient error handling and retry mechanisms
- ✅ Observable and monitorable system behavior

## Notes

- Each improvement can be implemented incrementally
- Focus on one area at a time to avoid breaking changes
- Maintain backward compatibility during transitions
- Document architectural decisions and patterns
- Consider performance implications of each change

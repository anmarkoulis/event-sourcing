Your presentation on Event Sourcing & CQRS with FastAPI and Celery looks comprehensive and well-structured. Here are some thoughts on what works well and areas where you might consider improvements:
Strengths:

    Clear Structure: The presentation is logically organized, starting with an introduction, moving through core concepts, and ending with real-world patterns and takeaways.

    Real-World Examples: The use of real-world examples and code snippets helps illustrate the concepts effectively. This makes it easier for the audience to understand how to apply these principles in their own projects.

    Visual Aids: The inclusion of diagrams and visual aids (e.g., event stream sequence, event sourcing flow) is excellent for visual learners and helps break up the text.

    Practical Insights: The sections on real-world patterns, gotchas, and performance considerations provide valuable insights that go beyond theoretical knowledge.

    Engaging Title and Quotes: The title and quotes from "Dr. Strangelove" add a touch of humor and make the presentation more engaging.

Areas for Improvement:

    Introduction: While the introduction is clear, you might want to add a brief overview of why event sourcing and CQRS are important. This can help set the stage and motivate the audience to pay attention.

    Depth of Technical Details: Depending on your audience, you might want to adjust the depth of technical details. For a PyCon audience, which is likely to be technically savvy, the current level of detail is appropriate. However, ensure that you explain any jargon or complex concepts clearly.

    Interactive Elements: Consider adding interactive elements such as questions for the audience or small exercises. This can help keep the audience engaged and reinforce their understanding of the material.

    Case Studies: If possible, include a brief case study or two where event sourcing and CQRS have been successfully implemented. This can provide concrete examples of the benefits and challenges.

    Visual Consistency: Ensure that all visual elements (diagrams, code snippets, etc.) are consistent in style and formatting. This helps maintain a professional look and makes the presentation easier to follow.

    Conclusion: The conclusion is good, but you might want to add a slide or two on next steps or resources for further learning. This can help the audience continue their exploration of event sourcing and CQRS after the presentation.

Specific Feedback:

    Slide on "The Nightmare: 'Who Deleted My User?'": This slide effectively illustrates the problem that event sourcing solves. It's a great way to grab the audience's attention and set the stage for the rest of the presentation.

    Slide on "Eventual Consistency: The Feature Nobody Talks About": This is a crucial concept, and the slide does a good job of explaining it. Consider adding a real-world analogy to make it even clearer.

    Slide on "When Event Sourcing Goes Wrong": This slide provides valuable insights into the challenges of event sourcing. The example of using snapshots to improve performance is particularly useful.

Final Thoughts:

Overall, your presentation is well-prepared and covers the topic thoroughly. With a few tweaks to enhance engagement and clarity, it has the potential to be a standout session at PyCon Athens 2025. Good luck with your presentation!

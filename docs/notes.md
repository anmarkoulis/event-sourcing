# Speaker Notes: Event Sourcing & CQRS with FastAPI and Celery

## Section 1: Opening Story

### Slide 1: Title Slide
**Key Points:**
- Welcome everyone to PyCon Athens
- Mention this is about a mindset shift in how we think about data
- The title is a play on "Dr. Strangelove" - events can be scary but powerful
- Set expectation: 30 minutes, lots of code examples, interactive

**Speaking Notes:**
"Good morning everyone! I'm excited to be here at PyCon Athens. Today we're going to talk about something that might sound scary at first - raw events. But by the end of this talk, I hope you'll see why I've learned to love them. This is about a fundamental shift in how we think about data in our systems."

---

### Slide 2: Who Am I?
**Key Points:**
- Reference the movie title and create the connection
- Establish credibility as a staff engineer
- Show academic background with a joke
- Share the personal journey with events
- Create a natural, engaging introduction

**Speaking Notes:**
"Some of you might be wondering about this title. It's a play on the classic Stanley Kubrick film 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.' In our case, the bomb is complex distributed systems, the worrying is traditional debugging nightmares, and the love is embracing event sourcing's power. I'm a staff engineer who's been working with Python for over a decade. I studied Physics, then Computational Physics, and then made the switch to software engineering. I went from calculating planet trajectories to debugging production systems - turns out, both involve a lot of uncertainty! My journey with events started with 'Events are too complex!' and ended with 'Events are the solution to complexity!' I'm passionate about building systems with quality."

---

### Slide 3: What We'll Discuss
**Key Points:**
- Introduce the structure and what will be covered
- Set expectations for the talk

**Speaking Notes:**
"Today we'll cover three main areas. First, the core principles of event sourcing and CQRS - how to store every change as an immutable event and separate read and write concerns. Second, how the Python ecosystem offers excellent solutions for this - FastAPI for APIs, Celery for async processing, and Pydantic for data validation. Finally, we'll look at the aftermath - real-world patterns, performance considerations, and how to debug and test in an immutable world."

---

### Slide 4: The Nightmare: "Who Deleted My User?"
**Key Points:**
- Tell a compelling debugging story
- Show the real pain of traditional systems
- Make it relatable to everyone in the audience
- Set up the motivation for event sourcing

**Speaking Notes:**
"Let me tell you a story that probably sounds familiar. Monday 3:47 PM - someone reports that Sarah's account is missing. Tuesday 9:15 AM - we're still trying to figure out when it was deleted, who did it, and why. With traditional systems, we can't answer any of these questions. The system has no memory of what happened. This is the nightmare we all face when debugging production issues."

---

### Slide 5: Enter Event Sourcing: The System That Remembers
**Key Points:**
- Show the solution with concrete examples
- Demonstrate the fundamental shift
- Highlight the immediate benefits
- Build excitement for the solution

**Speaking Notes:**
"Event sourcing is the solution. Instead of deleting data forever, we record what happened as an immutable event. Now we can answer everything: when it was deleted, who did it, why, and even what the user's data was before deletion. Every action becomes a permanent record. This is the fundamental shift - from systems that forget to systems that remember."

---

### Slide 6: The Journey: From Chaos to Clarity
**Key Points:**
- Transition from problem to solution
- Introduce the building blocks
- Set up the theoretical foundation
- Keep the narrative flowing

**Speaking Notes:**
"Now that we've seen the problem and the solution, let's understand the building blocks. We need to understand events as immutable facts, event streams as the story of an entity, CQRS as the separation of reading and writing, and how the Python ecosystem implements all of this. The goal is to build systems that can explain themselves."

---

## Section 2: Core Concepts (Theory with Real-World Examples)

### Slide 7: Core Concepts: The Building Blocks
**Key Points:**
- Introduce the first building block: Events
- Show concrete event structure
- Emphasize immutability
- Connect to the debugging story

**Speaking Notes:**
"Let's start with the first building block: Events. Every change in our system becomes an immutable event. Here's what a UserCreated event looks like - it has an event_id, aggregate_id, timestamp, event_type, and the actual data. The key principle is that events are immutable facts - they never change once created. This is what gives us the audit trail we need for debugging."

---

### Slide 8: Event Streams: The Story of an Entity
**Key Points:**
- Show how events belong to ordered sequences
- Demonstrate the concept of a user's complete story
- Emphasize the source of truth concept
- Connect to time travel capabilities

**Speaking Notes:**
"Events aren't isolated - they belong to ordered sequences called event streams. Here's a user's complete story: UserCreated, UserNameChanged, UserEmailChanged, UserStatusChanged, and finally UserDeleted. The stream is the source of truth - we can rebuild any point in time by replaying these events in order. This is how we get time travel capabilities."

---

### Slide 9: CQRS: Separate Reading from Writing
**Key Points:**
- Show the problem with traditional mixed models
- Demonstrate the separation principle
- Connect to scalability concerns
- Set up the solution

**Speaking Notes:**
"Traditional systems mix everything together. Here's a typical UserService with update_user and get_user methods in the same class. The problem is that reads and writes have different requirements - reads need to be fast, writes need to be consistent. CQRS separates these concerns with different models for different purposes."

---

### Slide 10: CQRS: Commands vs Queries
**Key Points:**
- Show the command side components
- Show the query side components
- Emphasize the database separation
- Connect to scalability benefits

**Speaking Notes:**
"Here's how CQRS works in practice. On the command side, we have command handlers that process commands and call aggregates, aggregates that apply business logic and create events, an event store that persists events, and an event bus that publishes events. On the query side, we have query handlers that process queries, read models optimized for fast reads, and a separate database with no business logic. Different databases for different purposes."

---

### Slide 11: The Complete Picture: How Everything Connects
**Key Points:**
- Show end-to-end flow with real example using the diagram
- Demonstrate how all components work together
- Make it concrete and understandable
- Set up for implementation section

**Speaking Notes:**
"Here's how everything connects in a real-world example. This diagram shows what happens when a user changes their email. We start with a PUT request to FastAPI, which creates a ChangeEmailCommand. The command handler loads the existing aggregate from the event store, reconstructs the state by applying previous events, validates business rules, and creates a UserEmailChanged event. This gets appended to the user's stream with version checking for concurrency control. The event is published to the event bus, which triggers a Celery task that updates the read model through a projection. Finally, when the user queries their data, they get the updated information. Every change flows through this pattern - it's the complete event sourcing and CQRS workflow in action."

---

## Section 3: Python Ecosystem Implementation

### Slide 12: The Python Way: FastAPI + Celery
**Key Points:**
- Show the high-level architecture
- Introduce Python tools
- Emphasize the ecosystem's capabilities
- Set up for detailed implementation

**Speaking Notes:**
"Now let's see how the Python ecosystem implements this architecture. We use FastAPI for the API surface, Celery for async task processing, PostgreSQL or EventStoreDB for the event store, and RabbitMQ or Kafka for the event bus. The Python ecosystem provides excellent tools for each component of this architecture."

---

### Slide 13: Mapping: Theory to Python Implementation
**Key Points:**
- Show clear mapping between theory and implementation
- Demonstrate Python's strengths
- Emphasize the ecosystem's maturity
- Build confidence in the approach

**Speaking Notes:**
"Here's how each theoretical concept maps to Python implementation. Events become Pydantic models with validation. Event streams become PostgreSQL tables with versioning. Aggregates become domain classes with apply methods. Command handlers use FastAPI dependency injection. The event store uses the repository pattern with async/await. Projections become Celery tasks with event handlers. And read models become optimized database views. The Python ecosystem provides excellent tools for each concept."

---

### Slide 14: FastAPI: The Command Interface
**Key Points:**
- Show real FastAPI code
- Emphasize Pydantic validation
- Show immediate response pattern
- Keep it practical

**Speaking Notes:**
"Here's how we implement this with FastAPI. We define our endpoints to accept user data. We create commands using Pydantic models for validation. When a request comes in, we create a CreateUserCommand, get the appropriate handler from our infrastructure factory, and process the command. Notice we return immediately - we don't wait for the event to be processed. This gives us high availability and responsiveness."

---

### Slide 15: Command Handlers: Business Logic
**Key Points:**
- Show the CreateUserCommandHandler
- Emphasize the handle method pattern
- Show aggregate creation and event application
- Demonstrate clean separation

**Speaking Notes:**
"Command handlers are where the business logic lives. Here's our CreateUserCommandHandler with stream-based operations. The handle method loads the existing aggregate from the stream, reconstructs the state by applying all previous events, calls the domain method to validate and create an event, applies the event to the aggregate, appends to the stream with version checking for concurrency control, and publishes it to the event bus. This gives us clean separation between business logic and infrastructure concerns."

---

### Slide 16: Celery: Async Task Runner & Scalable Workers
**Key Points:**
- Show the Celery task
- Emphasize async processing
- Show the async_to_sync pattern
- Demonstrate flexibility

**Speaking Notes:**
"Celery is our async task runner and scalable workers. Here's how we implement it. We define a Celery task that takes event data. We use async_to_sync to convert our async function to sync for Celery. The async function creates an Event, gets the event handler, and processes it. Each task is independent and can be scaled separately. This gives us tremendous flexibility for processing different types of events."

---

### Slide 17: Projections: Event-Driven Read Models
**Key Points:**
- Show the UserProjection
- Demonstrate event-to-read-model transformation
- Show the event-driven nature
- Emphasize the separation

**Speaking Notes:**
"Projections are how we build read models from events. Here's our UserProjection. When a user_created event comes in, we build user data with aggregate_id, name, email, and created_at. We save this to the read model. This gives us event-driven read model updates that are optimized for queries."

---

### Slide 18: FastAPI: Query Interface
**Key Points:**
- Show the FastAPI query endpoints
- Demonstrate both current and historical queries
- Show the query handler pattern
- Emphasize the separation

**Speaking Notes:**
"Here's how we expose read models through FastAPI. We have endpoints for getting current user data and user history. For current data, we create a GetUserQuery, get the query handler from our infrastructure factory, and execute the query. For history, we create a GetUserHistoryQuery with optional date filters and get events from the event store. This gives us both current state and historical data through the same API."

---

## Section 4: Real-World Patterns & Gotchas

### Slide 19: The Aftermath: Real-World Patterns & Gotchas
**Key Points:**
- Introduce the real-world section
- Set expectations for practical advice
- Acknowledge that this is where things get real

**Speaking Notes:**
"Now let's talk about what happens when you actually build this. This is where theory meets reality. We'll cover eventual consistency, performance challenges, debugging superpowers, and when NOT to use event sourcing. Let's talk about the real challenges."

---

### Slide 20: Eventual Consistency: The Feature Nobody Talks About
**Key Points:**
- Address the consistency concern head-on
- Show why it's beneficial
- Give concrete examples
- Build confidence

**Speaking Notes:**
"Eventual consistency scares a lot of people, but it's actually a feature. Here's what happens: user creates an account, the event is stored, and the API returns success immediately. Meanwhile, event processing happens asynchronously, and the read model is updated eventually. The reality is: users see success immediately - great UX, data appears in UI within seconds - acceptable, and processing can retry on failure - resilient. Eventual consistency is a feature, not a bug."

---

### Slide 21: When Event Sourcing Goes Wrong
**Key Points:**
- Address the performance concern
- Show the snapshot pattern
- Demonstrate the improvement
- Keep it practical

**Speaking Notes:**
"One concern with event sourcing is performance - what if you have thousands of events? Here's the problem: replaying 10,000 events takes 5 seconds. The solution is snapshots. We periodically save the state of our aggregates. When we need to build state, we start from the latest snapshot and only replay events after that. This gives us the best of both worlds - performance and auditability."

---

### Slide 22: Debugging Superpowers: The Immutable World
**Key Points:**
- Show debugging superpowers
- Give concrete examples
- Emphasize the value
- Connect to real scenarios

**Speaking Notes:**
"This is where event sourcing really shines - debugging. Traditional debugging is like 'I don't know what happened' - check logs maybe, check database current state only, ask users unreliable. Event sourcing debugging is 'I can see exactly what happened' - we get all events around a timestamp, see every change with timestamps and data, and can replay to see the exact state. Every change is recorded - nothing is lost."

---

### Slide 23: The Dark Side: When NOT to Use Event Sourcing
**Key Points:**
- Be honest about limitations
- Show when it's overkill
- Help audience make informed decisions
- Prevent misuse

**Speaking Notes:**
"Event sourcing is NOT for everything. It's overkill for simple CRUD applications. It has a steep learning curve for teams new to distributed systems. Traditional logging suffices for systems with simple audit requirements. And it has overhead for performance-critical reads. Event sourcing is for systems that need to explain themselves."

---

### Slide 24: Real-World Trade-offs
**Key Points:**
- Show honest trade-offs
- Help audience make informed decisions
- Emphasize that it's not a silver bullet
- Set realistic expectations

**Speaking Notes:**
"Here are the real trade-offs. What you gain: complete audit trail, time travel, debugging superpowers, and scalability. What you lose: simplicity, immediate consistency, storage overhead, and learning curve. Event sourcing is a trade-off, not a silver bullet. You need to understand these trade-offs to make informed decisions."

---

### Slide 25: Key Takeaways
**Key Points:**
- Reinforce the main points
- Connect back to the opening story
- End with a clear message
- Set up for questions

**Speaking Notes:**
"Here's what we learned. Event sourcing is about building systems that can explain themselves. Python + FastAPI + Celery are more than capable for serious architecture. Eventual consistency is a feature, not a bug. Performance requires design - snapshots, indexing, caching. And event sourcing is not for every system - know when to use it. The goal is to build systems that can explain themselves 6 months from now."

---

### Slide 26: Thank You
**Key Points:**
- Thank the audience
- Invite questions
- End warmly

**Speaking Notes:**
"Thank you all for your attention. I hope I've convinced you that raw events are worth loving. I'm happy to take questions. Let's have a great discussion!"

- AI is allowed to say "I don't know".
- AI must cite quotes and sources for each of its claims. It must also verify each claim by finding a supporting quote after it generates a response. If it canâ€™t find a quote, it must retract the claim.

Verification steps:

1. Check official documentation for the exact syntax, either on the official documentation page, github, PyPi, etc.
2. Verify method signatures and parameters
3. Confirm return types and error handling patterns
4. Review version compatibility and deprecation notices
5. Check for breaking changes in recent versions

Never suggest code patterns based on:

- Memory or assumptions about library APIs
- Similar patterns from other libraries
- Outdated or unverified information
- Guesswork about method names or signatures

Always include:

- Direct links to official documentation
- Version numbers being referenced
- Alternative approaches if primary method is deprecated
- Clear indication when syntax is verified vs. estimated

Documentation sources to check:

- Official library documentation
- GitHub repository README and examples
- Package manager registry pages
- Release notes and changelogs
- Official tutorials and guides
